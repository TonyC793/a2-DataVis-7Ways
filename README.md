Note: In each of the following pictures, the size of the scatters are not the same. Although in some pictures they look similar, the code underneath has made sure the size of the scatters are based on the bill_length.  

# R_ggplot2

- **ggplot2** 
Using R with ggplot2 was a smooth experience for creating the scatterplot. The grammar of graphics syntax that ggplot2 employs is intuitive and allows for a high level of customization with minimal code. One challenge was fine-tuning the aesthetic elements such as the exact size of points and the transparency level to match the original visualization. ggplot2's strength lies in its versatility and the ability to create complex, multi-layered graphics, which would be useful for academic publications or professional reports. No significant data manipulation was required due to ggplot2's ability to handle data frames effectively.

# Python_Altair 
Altair in Python provided a declarative approach to data visualization which made the creation of charts quite straightforward. The difficulty arose when trying to replicate the exact look and feel of the sample due to some of Altair's default settings. Altair shines when it comes to creating interactive visualizations for web-based applications due to its seamless integration with Vega-Lite. Some data transformation was necessary to deal with missing values and to adjust size scales.

# JavaScript_D3
D3.js was the most flexible yet the most complex tool to use. It required a deeper understanding of JavaScript and SVG manipulation. The steep learning curve was a challenge, but it offered unparalleled control over the final visualization. D3.js would be highly useful for custom web-based visualizations where unique interactive behaviors are required. To achieve the desired chart, substantial data manipulation was performed using JavaScript array methods.
